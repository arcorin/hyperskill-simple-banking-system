About
Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with database.

Learning outcomes
In this project, you will find out how the banking system works and learn about SQL. We'll also see how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number. As an overall result, you'll get new experience in Python.

Stage 1/4: Card anatomy
Find out what a credit card consists of (create account)

Stage 2/4: Luhn algorithm
Implement Luhn Algorithm to check the card number for validity (generate and check, card number and pin, log in and log out)

Stage 3/4: I'm so lite
Create a database and store your data in it (create database and table, insert and update table)

Stage 4/4: Advanced system
Improve system by extending its fuctionality (add and transfer money, check destination account number, delete account)
